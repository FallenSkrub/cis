Define recursion:
    Recursion is the repeatitions of a loop of steps; where it slowly breaks down an object or a number into smaller parts until it cannot be any smaller, which is known as the base.
What is one way recursion?
    One way recursion is when if the base condition is true, the program stops and returns. If it isn't it calls itself again until it can reach the base condition.
What is two way recursion?
    Two way recursion is when the action is performed on call, and it passes into the function. Instead of repeating everything normally, it is able to do its work in a different way.
What is linear recursion?
    Linear recursion is when a function has to call itself once.
What is non linear recursion?
    Non linear recursion, is when it has to call itself two or more times which links back to one and two way recursion.
